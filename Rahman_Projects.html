                <p data-indent="1"> For the scratch project, I began by brainstorming different ideas and looking up how I could recreate these visions in Scratch.  I eventually chose to use a space battleship-type game and began to look up images to use for sprites. Once all of the base code was done, I tested my code constantly until the game neared protection. To end the project, we had a class gallery-walk where everyone got to try eachother's game. It was definitely a great experience.</p>

                <p data-indent="1"> For the App Inventor Project, we began by forming pairs and making a team desicion on which game template we wpuld use. Once we chose the mini golf base, we completed the base code and confirmed that there were no bugs by testing through the tablets. After getting checked off, we changed certain aspects of the game, adding new levels, difficulties, and changing the sprites to become more interactive.This allowed the user to play for a longer period of time because of all the different levels. </p>

                <p data-indent="1"> For the Hangman Project, we began by brainstorming ideas based on how we could make the game itself work, without branching out onto further ideas. Once we had a general basis for the code, we programmed a base algorithm that would randomize different words when the program is run, along with an introduvtion to teach the user how to play. Next, Jeff(My partner) had the idea to use text-art to create a more interactive interface for the user as thy play. This provided a visual representation for the person playing. After we made the final touches, we had a class gallery walk and recieved beneficial feedback to improve the game. </p>

                <p data-indent="1"> My partner and I began this project by brainstorming an idea to bas our game on. We ended up choosing a gamestyle similar to Oregon Trail because it would be more interactive for the user and would be different from many of the other games created by our classmates. We developed an inventory along with a storyline to help develop the plot. We then created an algorithm to help the game flow in order and confirmed that everything worked soundly before the gallery walk. The game ended up working and we received meaningful feedback from our classmates.  </p>
