                            <p> Hi, my name is Tariq Rahman. I live in Dublin, California, and I am currently taking the Intro to Engineering Design Course at Dublin High School.  I also took a similar PLTW course at Fallon Middle School to help me gain a better view of what to expect as I continue along the Engineering Pathway throughout High School and hopefully into college.  So far the courses I have taken include PLTW Green Architecture, PLTW Computer Engineering, and the course I am participating in now, Introduction To Engineering Design.  As I gain more experience through these classes, I hope to pursue a career in engineering, particularly as a computer hardware engineer.  Since I was in elementary school, the idea of being an engineer and designing products of any kind excited me. I felt that I could be a benefit to our modern day society, and have a positive effect on others lives, by making improvements on items that people use on daily basis. Fortunately, I have been given the opportunity to start early by taking courses in Middle and High School that will better prepare me for working in the real world and actually making those dreams a reality. 
                 During my researching and observing of the average day of an engineer, I have found that their are many skills and attributes a person can acquire to better prepare themselves for actually pursuing this career.  Many of these skills can translate into our daily lives.  A few of these skills I find most important that I possess myself include being calm in pressure situations, being open-minded of others, and persistent as not to give up on a problem immediately.  In both life in general and the engineering workplace, these attributes are essential.  I have been in many situations where these skills have helped me overcome lofty challenges.  One example where I have needed to be persistent is with the recycled race car project we were assigned this year in IED. For this project, we needed to make a car with recycled materials only, along with many other constraints.  My group had tried several different strategies to make our car run, but none of them worked.  Although our final car did not get first place, the car definitely improved from the original model, by more than a meter.  This may  not seem like very much, but without the ability to be persistent, my group and I would not have been able to complete even the minimum requirement for this project.  So far this year, I have been through a lot more than I had originally thought I would.  I joined the Givelight Club, an organization that raises money for Syrian refugees and Orphans in other countries. I have been to several packing events for this club and hope to improve to a higher role in the club as my time in high school progresses.
               Throughout my life, I have been in many experiences that have helped me learn who I am, the areas I excel, and the areas I can improve in.  A few things I am good at that would immensely benefit me in the engineering workplace and environment is my ability to work in teams, and also being able to take care of a situation while under pressure from others to get the job done.  I have been playing basketball since First Grade, and since then, have significantly improved.  I have been in national tournaments, and found myself in pressure situations several times where my team has relied on me to make a split-second decision that could change the outcome of the game.  Fortunately, over time, I have learned to keep calm in these scenarios and take everything one step at a time.  These experiences give me an advantage over others who are having to deal with this for the first time  I hope to use these skills to give me a boost as I continue on this engineering pathway throughout my life.
             Engineering is an important part of my life, that I would like to continue to grow in, and share with others.  Thank You for taking the time to read about me, and I hope you enjoy the rest of this site.
